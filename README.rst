Mission
-------
The DoCookBook project aims to create an open source book about DocBook and the DocBook XSL 
stylesheets written in a cookbook-style manner and released under a Creative Commons license.


Concept
-------
This book is written in a "cookbook" style. The book contains "topics"
which are divided into a problem, the corresponding solution, some 
discussions, and optional related information.
It is very easy just to go to the table of contents and see if there
is something useful that fits to your problem.
Solutions are usually written in a procedural style which contain
several steps.


Target Group
------------
It is assumed you have a decent knowledge about XML and DocBook. It doesn't
hurt if you know CSS and XSLT. As such, it is aimed more at DocBook 
developers than writers.


Structure of the Book and Organization
--------------------------------------

The main file is "en/xml/DocBook-Cookbook.xml". It contains xi:include
elements which refer to chapters, appendices and other second level
elements.

::
  
  # Structure of Book with Main Chapters 
  en/xml/DocBook-Cookbook.xml
  |
  +-- 5.1/        # (1)
  |
  +-- common/     # (2)
  |
  +-- db/         # (3)
  |
  +-- epub/       # (4)
  | 
  +-- fo/         # (5)
  |
  +-- html/       # (6)
  |
  +-- structure/ # (7)

::
  
  (1) Contains the DocBook Schema and possible customizations
  (2) Contains topics to common customizations
  (3) Contains topics to DocBook's markup
  (4) Planned: will contain customizations to EPUB output format
  (5) Contains topics to FO customizations
  (6) Contains topics to HTML, XHTML, and other customizations based on HTML
  (7) Contains topics how to manipulate DocBook's structure


Some topics contain directories which store XSLT, XML, or other example files.
In some cases these are incorporated into the XML source, sometimes they are
just lying around for testing purposes.

Each topic is a self-contained matter of a specific problem and its solution
with discussion. Use the skeleton file "en/xml/topic.empty.xml"  as a starting point.
It contains the basic structure and you just need to add the flesh of your topic.

How to build the book
---------------------

Currently, building the book works but it's not as nice as I would
like to see it.

* Building chunked HTML: use ./bin/dbsaxon
* Building single HTML: use bin/dbsaxon9 

At the moment, it is a mixture of XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 stylesheets.
To avoid maintaing two different CSS files (one for the XSLT 1.0 output,
the other for 2.0), the HTML files coming from XSLT 1.0 are "cleaned up".
This cleanup step makes the structure compatible to the XSLT 2.0 output.


How you can help
----------------

* Find typos, grammar problems, inconsistencies, or plain errors
* Send me patches
* Write your own topic
