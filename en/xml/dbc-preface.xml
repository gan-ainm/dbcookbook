    </footnote>&mdash;I always felt there is a gap. This gap could be bridged
    with a guide that only concentrates on problems and their solution
    in a concise manner explained by step-by-step procedures. Until now,
    nobody wrote a book that combines possible problems, pitfalls,
      how-tos, and the benefits in a cookbook
    style. My book is intented to be such a book. However, it
      <emphasis>does not</emphasis> seek to replace any other
    information, be it printed or online. It aims for
      <emphasis>enhancing</emphasis> the world of DocBook with a
    different view. </para>
  <para> The topics in this book are mostly based on my own experiences
    with DocBook and the DocBook XSL stylesheets. However, it also
    includes questions and answers from other sources: from the DocBook
    mailinglists, other sites that inspired me, or questions from
    colleagues. It is the nature of such topics that there might be some
    overlap with other sources. When other authors inspired me, I have
    included their names. If you think your name is missing, please let
    me know. </para>
  <para>As I have learned (and still do) a lot from the masters of DocBook,
    it is time to give something back. What you are reading is the first
    draft of the fruits of these efforts.
    Currently, this book is available under a
    Creative Commons license (see <xref linkend="legalnotice"/> if you
    want to know more). I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I
    enjoy writing it. </para>

  <section xml:id="dbc.preface.audience">
    <title>Audience</title>
    <para>This book covers topics which range from very easy to pretty
      demanding. The more challenging a problem is, the more you need
      experience from different domains (CSS, FO, XSLT, etc.) As such,
      this book does not and cannot attempt to teach you DocBook or any
      such related technology (with the exception of <xref
        linkend="dbc.markup"/>). If you want to learn DocBook or need
      some help with XML or XSLT, search elsewhere. There is plenty of
      information available either online or printed. </para>
    <para>This book is aimed at DocBook users who write
        <emphasis>and</emphasis> seek answers for their customization
      problems. However, with some trial and error, it can also be useful
      for ordinary writers who want to try something out. For readers
      who want further information, links are included in the <citetitle>See
        Also</citetitle> section at the end of each topic. </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="dbc.preface.db4-vs-5">
    <title>DocBook 4 or 5?</title>
    <para>Although a lot of these topics can be used for both versions
      with minimal changes, this book focuses on DocBook&#xa0;5. Why?
      There are several reasons: </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>DocBook&#xa0;4 is in maintenance mode and DocBook&#xa0;5
          is the future.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>I wanted to show exhaustive examples for DocBook&#xa0;5. With
          this book, I hope, users can learn how to adopt and use it.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is easy to transform DocBook&#xa0;4 into version 5 as
          shown in <xref linkend="dbc.structure.db4-to-db5"/>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It simplifies writing <emphasis>a lot</emphasis> if you
          can concentrate on only one version and not on two. It is also
          easier to read for you.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The differences are documented in the <citetitle>DocBook5: The
        Definitive Guide</citetitle> book, section <citetitle
        xlink:href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/ch01.html#introduction-whats-new"
        >What’s New in DocBook V5.0?</citetitle>.</para>

    <para>Apart from the DocBook examples, the transformation examples
      are currently based on the DocBook XSL 1.0 stylesheets.
      They are stable, well-documented and can be used with any XSLT 1.0
      processor.
    </para>
    <para>On the other side, there is always the tension between
      implementing new concepts and retaining backward compatibility.
      For this reason, the XSLT 1.0 stylesheets are rewritten for XSLT
      2.0. This task is not finished yet. As soon as they are
      production-stable, they will be covered in this book too.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="dbc.preface.further-reading">
    <title>Further Readings</title>
    <para>By no means is this book complete. As this book is based on
      technologies like CSS, XML, (X)HTML, and XSLT, it is always a good
      idea to seek other information. I highly recommend to read the
      books by <personname>
        <firstname>Norman</firstname>
        <surname>Walsh</surname>
      </personname> and <personname>

<!--  <section xml:id="dbc.preface.code">
    <title>About the Code Examples</title>
    <para>As XML code tend to be verbose, all code examples in this book
      are intentionally kept concise. That means, in same cases, only
      the relevant portions of the code is shown to avoid distraction.
      Code that is not important is reduced to three dots
        (<literal>...</literal>). Unfortunately, this could lead to
      examples which are not well-formed or even invalid.</para>

    <para>Another important point about the examples are namespaces. The
      namespace declarations are usually not shown if they aren't
      necessary or <quote>well-known</quote>. In most cases it is
      recommended to declare them in the root element anyway. In this
      book all the well-known namespace prefixes (if given) and
      namespace URLs are collected in <xref linkend="tab.prefix-and-ns"
      />. Although a namespace prefix can be selected freely, it is
      common practise to use the well-established name in the
      table.</para>
    <para>For example, to use XLink (a syntax for referencing content),
      declare the XLink namespace in the root element by using the
      prefix (here: <tag class="prefix">xlink</tag>) with the XLink
      namespace:</para>
    <screen>&lt;book <emphasis
      role="bold">xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"</emphasis
      > ...></screen>
    <para>Once declared, the namespace prefix is bound to its namespace
      URL and can be used wherever it is needed:</para>
    <screen>&lt;link <emphasis role="bold">xlink</emphasis>:href="...">...&lt;/link></screen>
