    <para>When people need quotes, they usually write
      <phrase>"this"</phrase>. However, from a typographical point of
      view, this is wrong. There are special start and end quotation
      characters. The more elegant way is to use <quote>this</quote>.
    </para>
    <para>However, the opening and closing characters are language-dependent.
      Many languages have different quotation rules. German readers
      prefer <quote xml:lang="de">this</quote>, French <quote
        xml:lang="fr">this</quote>, and the Italians use <quote
        xml:lang="it">this</quote>.</para>
    <para>Using quote markers directly has one disadvantage: if your
      text contains different languages you need to know how quotes are
      displayed in the respective language. Moreover, it is easier and more
      consistent to leave this typographic detail to the DocBook
      stylesheets.</para>
    <para>One nice thing with inserting <tag>quote</tag> is that it can be
      adapted to a different language by using the <tag
        class="attribute">xml:lang</tag> attribute:</para>
    <programlisting language="xml"
    >&lt;para>This is a &lt;quote xml:lang="de">German quote&lt;/quote>.&lt;/para></programlisting>

       TODO:
        Often in literary (fiction and sometimes nonfiction) text, quotation
        marks are unbalanced - an open quote is not closed at the end of a
        paragraph, and is the quotation resumes with an open quote in the
        following paragraph.
        For example:
          “I advise against this usage....
 	  “Because it makes things difficult for DocBook developers.”
        The writer Joseph Conrad did this all the time, for pages on
        end-when a character tells a long story to his shipmates.  So I call
        them "Conrad Quotes."
